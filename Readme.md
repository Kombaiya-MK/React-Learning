# React Basics

This repository contains my learning resource from the course "React Basics" from Meta Frontend Development Professional Course offered by Coursera.

## What is React?

1. React is a javascript library which is used build Single Page Applications(SPA).
2. React follows component based structure. It allows us to split the part of the webpage into components and reuse it.

## Transpiling JSX

- Transpiling is a process of convert some high-level code into machine readable code.
- A browser can not understand JSX components.So inorder to render the components we have convert the JSX code pure javascript code.
- For transpiling some modern technologies are being used. One of the famous compiler is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
